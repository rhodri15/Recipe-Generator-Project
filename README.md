# Recipe-Generator-Project

This Repo contains numerous modules of python code which together allow a user to generate a random recipe from a selection or recipe books.

When the user runs the main.py module they will be prompted to choose a book and a food type.
If the user DOES NOT want to select a book and/or food type, simply press Enter when the prompts arise.
If the user DOES want to select a book and/or food type, then type the answers when prompted.
A list of all valid book answers are in the file BookTitles.md
A list of all valid food types are in the file BookChapters.md


Running the main.py module will output a message explaining which book, chapter, and page the random recipe is from.
